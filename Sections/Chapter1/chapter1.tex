\section{The first steps}
You know what are some really great papers? These: \cite{gabryelczykHydrogenBondGuidance2019,heesSelfassemblyOppositelyCharged2019,swinkelsRevealingPseudorotationRingopening2021}! Also, if I want to refer to an online video~\cite{ExampleVideo}, I can do that as well. By default, it will end up in a separate bibliography page! Neat! Look at Figure \ref{fig:ch1-dog}b! It is beautiful!

Look at Figure \ref{fig:ch1-dog}b! It is beautiful! 

\begin{figure}

  \caption{
    \textcolor{\chapclr}{Pure beauty.}
    I did something and I don't know how, and now I am writing that down somehow. Do you notice how the Figure caption is smaller than the main text, and that there is a small indentation on the left? You can change that! Also, the distance between this text and the main text can be controlled!
