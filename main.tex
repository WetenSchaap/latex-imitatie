% I prefer to put images in a folder for the chapter itsself. You can also put all images in a single dedicated folder, in that case, you can set that here:
% \graphicspath{{./images/}}

% Set up your cover page:
\title{An example thesis}
\subtitle{A clever joke as subtitle always works well}
\author{P.J.M. Swinkels}
\date{}

% Set pdf metadata:
\hypersetup{%
    pdfauthor={Piet J.M. Swinkels},
    pdftitle={An example thesis: A clever joke as subtitle always works well},
    pdfsubject={Soft Matter Physics},   % Or whatever the subject of your thesis is
    pdfkeywords={Soft matter; Self-assembly; Colloids; Patchy particles; Critical Casimir effect},

    \maketitle                                   % This is the coverpage, most books have a sort of pre-titlepage immediatly after the outside cover, with just title and author.
