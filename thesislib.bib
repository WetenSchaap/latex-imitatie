  abstract = {The assembly of oppositely charged block copolymers, containing small thermoresponsive moieties, was investigated as a function of salt concentration and temperature. Aqueous solutions of poly-[N-isopropylacrylamide]-b-poly[dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate] (NIPAM44-b-DMAEMA216) and PNIPAM-b-poly[acrylic acid]-b-PNIPAM (NIPAM35-b-AA200-b-NIPAM35) were mixed in equal charge stoichiometry, and analysed by light scattering (LS), NMR spectroscopy and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). At room temperature, two different micelle morphologies were found at different salt concentrations. At NaCl concentrations below 0.75 M, complex coacervate core micelles (C3M) with a PNIPAM corona were formed as a result of interpolyelectrolyte complexation. At NaCl concentrations exceeding 0.75 M, the C3M micelles inverted into PNIPAM cored micelles (PCM), containing a water soluble polyelectrolyte corona. This behavior is ascribed to the salt concentration dependence of both the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of PNIPAM, and the complex coacervation. Above 0.75 M NaCl, the PNIPAM blocks are insoluble in water at room temperature, while complexation between the polyelectrolytes is prevented because of charge screening by the salt. Upon increasing the temperature, both types of micelles display a cloud point temperature (Tcp), despite the small thermoresponsive blocks, and aggregate into hydrogels. These hydrogels consist of a complexed polyelectrolyte matrix with microphase separated PNIPAM domains. Controlling the morphology and aggregation of temperature sensitive polyelectrolytes can be an important tool for drug delivery systems, or the application and hardening of underwater glues.},

  abstract = {Colloids have a rich history of being used as ‘big atoms’ mimicking real atoms to study crystallization, gelation and the glass transition of condensed matter. Emulating the dynamics of molecules, however, has remained elusive. Recent advances in colloid chemistry allow patchy particles to be synthesized with accurate control over shape, functionality and coordination number. Here, we show that colloidal alkanes, specifically colloidal cyclopentane, assembled from tetrameric patchy particles by critical Casimir forces undergo the same chemical transformations as their atomic counterparts, allowing their dynamics to be studied in real time. We directly observe transitions between chair and twist conformations in colloidal cyclopentane, and we elucidate the interplay of bond bending strain and entropy in the molecular transition states and ring-opening reactions. These results open the door to investigate complex molecular kinetics and molecular reactions in the high-temperature classical limit, in which the colloidal analogue becomes a good model.},
